HTTP protocol is an application-layer protocol

HTTP `GET` is used to request data from a server to a browser.





- Rule One of Web-Dev: Always keep the Developer Console open on your web browser.
- List of HTTPS status codes:
    - _1xx informational response_ – the request was received, continuing process.
    - _2xx successful_ – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    - _3xx redirection_ – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
    - _4xx client error_ – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
    - _5xx server error_ – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request.
- HTTP `GET` is a method that is used to request data (such as images and HTML documents) from a server to a browser.
- When fetching data from a browser with an image, the HTML document will be gotten first then if an `img` tag is found in the HTML document, another request will be sent to get the image.
- A server can be created using Java Spring, Python Flask or Ruby on Rails.
- A webpage usually fetches data in the following order:
1. Document
2. Stylesheet
3. Script
