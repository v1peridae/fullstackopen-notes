- The first rule of web-development is to always keep the dev console open.
- The internet protocol suite:
    - Application layer - HTTPS/FTP/TLS/SSL
    - Transport layer - TCP / UDP / DCCP
    - Internet layer - IP(v4/v6)
    - Link Layer - MAC
- HTTP protocol is an application-layer protocol used to transmit HTML by communication between a browser and a server. It is a stateless protocol which means that the server does not keep any data between two requests.
- There are 5 kinds of HTTPS status codes:
1. **1xx informational response **– the request was received, continuing process.
2. **2xx successful** – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
3. **3xx redirection** – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
4. **4xx client error** – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
5. **5xx server error** – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request.
- HTTP `GET`   is used to request data from a server to a browser.
- In traditional web applications, the browser is "dumb". It only fetches HTML data from the server, and all application logic is on the server. A server can be created using Java Spring, Python Flask or Ruby on Rails to name just a few examples.
- When fetching data from a browser with an image, the HTML document will be gotten first then if an `img`  tag is found in the HTML document, another request will be sent to get the image.
- A server can be created using Java Spring, Python Flask or Ruby on Rails.
- A webpage usually fetches data in the following order:
1. Document (HTML)
2. Stylesheet (CSS)
3. Script (JS)
